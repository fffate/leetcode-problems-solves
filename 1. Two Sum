Q:
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].


Analysing
--------------------------
1）
1.simply think using one traversal， but how to record the passed nums?
2.use map to save the passed nums and their index cause we need the both value and their relation
  so this will esay solve the one traversal 
3.but the Time complexity wont't be O(n)， the act done by using map make that great.
  cause the put() and get() method will use more time，and if a collision happen it will go worse
  how to find a way to use one traversal without using extra space and time consuming？？？

2）
if anyone have a good way tha 1) could write it here



Solving
--------------------------
1)
using the Analysing as 1)
#code#
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        //int[] result = new int[2];
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap();
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;++i){
            int other = target - nums[i];
            if(map.containsKey(other)){
                return new int[]{map.get(other), i};
            }else{
                map.put(nums[i], i);
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
